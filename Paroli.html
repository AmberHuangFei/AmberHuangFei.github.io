                Learning in a foreign environment could be an exciting and challenging situation for <strong
                    class="strongP">international
                    students</strong> . The problem is more prominent when they are put in an environment that doesn't
                use
                their native
                language. They felt <strong class="strongP">outcasted </strong> the learning environment and increased
                social stress. Moreover, they
                might find the <strong class="strongP"> learning process stress-inducing</strong>. This project is
                dedicated
                to identifying a better solution for them
                to allow them to be more social and engage with native speakers. Thus, creating a <strong

                    <h4>Leading assumption</h4>
                    <li>
                        International students have difficulties communicating with native speakers due to a short
                        vocabulary and lack of confidence because of their accents.

                        games will bridge the student with native speakers</li>
                    <li> Communication in a group environment will incease engagement</li>

                    <h4>Competitive analysis</h4>
                    <p>I went on the Duolingo website and took screenshots of most of the learning experience.
                        Then write down the note to complete the analysis. To study the user experience closer
                        I also looked at the app review on App Store to understand the existing user pain point.
                        Doulingo had been a trending “meme” on the internet, it is an interesting research material
                        because it reflect the user experience and attitude toward the app.</p>

                   <P>In the first round of testing, I chart up the result into a chart to help me visualize the frustration and where the obsticles 
                       occurs in my wirefrem. This round of testing is the milestone in my development because it helped me re-ajust my project to approch 
                    user pain points and elevate my high fidelity prototype. </P>

            <p><strong class="strongP">Secondary research is more helpful</strong> then I expected. By reading professional studies on people's learning
                behaviour leading up to
                in depth design terms. I was able to come up with <strong class="strongP">solution that follows the user psychology</strong> and help
                them feel more at ease during
                each of my testing.

                <br>
                <strong class="strongP">User research is not only about collecting massive data.</strong> For the user research of this project, I had
                pay more thought into crafting
                my question and making sure I'm asking the right questions. During the interview sessions noting down
                specific senario is key to  <strong class="strongP">create
                    a grounded user case</strong>, and with a good user case I was able to come up with specific solution that is
                effective to their pain points.

            <h6>Improvment</h6>
            <h5>How would I take it to the next level?</h5>
            <p>This is the first big project that I completed on my own, the biggest problem is having too much freedom,
                it is <strong class="strongP">easy to have the project
                    go out of scope</strong>. I find it really frustrating when I realize I can come up with a better solution but
                time does not allow me to continue with
                more testing. I had learn to control my project scope and <strong class="strongP">focues on a specific user flow </strong>instead of
                trying to jam all the possible solution in
                one project.
                <br>
                <br>
                Having more opportunity to <strong class="strongP">commiunitcate with more professional</strong> and get more critiques, with a third person point
                of view I would be able to spot more
                issues or possibilities in this project. More over I could take this project to the next level.
