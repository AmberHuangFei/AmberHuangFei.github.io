            <h3>Language learning needs more support</h3>
            <p>
                Learning in a foreign environment could be an exciting and challenging situation for <strong
                    class="strongP">international
                    students</strong>. The problem is more prominent when they are put in an environment that doesn't
                use
                their native
                language. They felt <strong class="strongP">outcasted </strong>in the learning environment and increased
                social stress. Moreover, they
                might find the <strong class="strongP"> learning process stress-inducing</strong>. This project is
                dedicated
                to identifying a better solution for them
                to allow them to be more social and engage with native speakers. Thus, creating a <strong
                    class="strongP">healthy collaborative language learning community</strong>.

                    <h3>Research</h3>
                    <h4>Leading assumptions</h4>
                    <li>
                        International students have difficulties communicating with native speakers due to a short
                        vocabulary and lack of confidence because of their accents.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        games will bridge the student with native speakers</li>
                    <li> Communication in a group environment will increase engagement</li>
                    <li>Note-taking is the most effective method for students to review and back-track</li>

                <div class="researchsec">
                    <h4>Competitive analysis</h4>
                    <p>I went on the Duolingo website and took screenshots of the primary user flow of the learning experience.
                        Then write down the note to complete the analysis to study the user experience closer.
                        I also looked at the app review on App Store to understand the existing user pain point.
                        Duolingo has been a trending “meme” on the internet, and it is an exciting research material
                        because it reflects the user experience and attitude toward the app. The significant finding in looking at these materials helped me understand users feel pressured to keep up with their learning habits.

            <p><strong class="strongP">Secondary research is more helpful</strong> than I expected. By reading professional studies on people's learning

                in-depth design terms. I was able to come up with <strong class="strongP">solution that follows the user psychology</strong> and help

            <h6>Improvement</h6>
            <h5>How would I take it to the next level?</h5>
            <p> PAROLI is the first big project that I completed on my own. The biggest problem I first encountered is having "too much freedom",
                it is <strong class="strongP">easy to have the project
                go out of scope</strong>. I find it frustrating when I realize I can develop a better solution, but
                time does not allow me to continue with
                more testing. I had learned to control my project scope and <strong class="strongP">focues on a specific user flow </strong>instead of
                trying to jam all the possible solutions into
                one project.
                <br>
                <br>
                Having more opportunities to <strong class="strongP">commiunitcate with more professionals </strong> and get more critiques from a third person point
                of view, I would be able to spot more
                issues or possibilities in this project. Moreover, I could take this project to the next level.
