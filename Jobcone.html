       <h3>Struggle are unseperable with job hunt</h3>
       <p>
        I was inspired to look at a possible solution 
        to benefit first-time job seekers, I took my initiative on <strong class="strongjob">new grad students</strong> as my primary user group.
         Job hunting is tricky, and people might overlook a lot of rules.
        By <strong class="strongjob">researching their job hunting habits</strong> like planning their progress,summarizing insights and making connections. I came up with this project that 
        will<strong class="strongjob"> help improve their professionality and efficiency in job hunts.

            <p> Two sets of interview questions were prepared for this research. One of the sets is prepared 
                for people who are still in their job-seeking journey. I aim to identify their common application 
                behaviour, progress, and pain points; on the other hand, the second set of questions is prepared 
                for people who have completed their job hunt. My goals are to understand what they did and what 
                could be improved.

                            More calls to action need to be applied to the App the encourage users to interact with the information.
                            <br>
                            The interface is not clean enough for users to go through, find a better method to arrange the information
                            and don’t put all the information on one page. It’s too much for users to go through at once.
                            <br>
                            Cut out areas that don’t need to be on a separate page and make them into a dash/ smaller section.

                            Cleaning up dashboard information gives users more freedom to adjust what is most important to them. This implementation has reduced frustration by 40%.
                            <br>
                            Restructuring information in the job info by sectioning. Users had reflected the page is more scannable and easier to spot information.
                            <br>
                            Providing side pop-ups to highlight the update and provide quick access, 80% of the user would follow the pop-up and instructions through testing.
                          <br>
                            Combining sections that share similar functionality and leveraging their importance, I came up with a much easier flow for 96% of my participants to complete the test.
