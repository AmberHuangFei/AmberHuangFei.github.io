       <h3>Struggle are unseperable with job hunt</h3>
       <p>
        I was inspired to look at a possible solution 
        to benefit first-time job seekers, I took my initiative on <strong class="strongjob">new grad students</strong> as my primary user group.
         Job hunting is tricky, and people might overlook a lot of rules.
        By <strong class="strongjob">researching their job hunting habits</strong> like planning their progress,summarizing insights and making connections. I came up with this project that 
        will<strong class="strongjob"> help improve their professionality and efficiency in job hunts.

            <h4>Interview</h4>
            <p> Two sets of interview questions were prepared for this research. One of the sets is prepared 
                for people who are still in their job-seeking journey. I aim to identify their common application 
                behaviour, progress, and pain points; on the other hand, the second set of questions is prepared 
                for people who have completed their job hunt. My goals are to understand what they did and what 
                could be improved.

                            The interface is not clean enough for user to go through, find a better method to arrange the information
                            don’t put all the information in one page it’s too much for users to go through at onece.
                            <br>
                            Cut out area that dosen’t needs to be it’s own page and make them into a dash/ smaller section.

                         Cleaning up dashboard information and give user more freedom to adjust what is most improtant to them. This implimentation have reduce frustration by 40%.
                         <br>
                         Restrucureing information in the job info by sectioning. User had reflected the page are more scannable and easier to spot information.
                         <br>
                        Providing side pop-ups to high-light the update and provide quick acess, through testing 80% of the user would follow the pop up and instructions.
                         <br>
                         Combining section that share similar funcitonality, levraging their importance I came up with a much eaiser flow for 96% of my participants to complete the test.
