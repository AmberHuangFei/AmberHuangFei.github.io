        <h3>Healthy Eating habitno longer a hassle</h3>
        <p>
            This project is inspired by our daily observation as a college student.
            Eating healthy has been a challenge for students due to their stress and lifestyle.
            To develop a possible solution for this specific problem, the team researched the
            topic and discovered user pain points within four weeks. It revolves around bringing
            students more convenient methods to document their daily intake and charts to reflect
            their diet habits. The project led to a straightforward user interface, a 3D prototype
            and mock interaction with scanner function using Arduino and machine learning.

                    <h3>User Research</h3>
                    <p>College/University student groups are the centred user group for this project.
                        Through this project’s research, students have paid less attention to their eating
                        habits due to time, stress, and money.
                        The existing method on the market does not help solve their problem.
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        One typical healthy eating service that is trending on the market right now is
                        meal prep service. The problem with the existing solution is that they are
                        time-consuming and most importantly not accessible to all student groups.

                    <h5>How do we understand people better? </h5>
                    <p>Secondary research is more helpful then I expected. By reading professional studies on people's learning
                        behaviour leading up to
                        in depth design terms. I was able to come up with solution that follows the user psychology and help
                        them feel more at ease during
                        each of my testing.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        User research is not only about collecting massive data. For the user research of this project, I had
                        pay more thought into crafting
                        my question and making sure I'm asking the right questions. During the interview sessions noting down
                        specific senario is key to create
                        a grounded user case, and with a good user case I was able to come up with specific solution that is
                        effective to their pain points.

                    <p>This is the first big project that I completed on my own, the biggest problem is having too much freedom,
                        it is easy to have the project
                        go out of scope. I find it really frustrating when I realize I can come up with a better solution but
                        time does not allow me to continue with
                        more testing. I had learn to control my project scope and focues on a specific user flow instead of
                        trying to jam all the possible solution in
                        one project.

                        Having more opportunity to commiunitcate with more professional and critiques, with a third person point
                        of view I would be able to spot more
                        issues or possibilities in this project. More over I could take this project to the next level.
